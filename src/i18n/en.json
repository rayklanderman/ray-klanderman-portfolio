    "title": "Professional Profile",
    "description": "I build smart, scalable software and AI systems that solve real-world problems. My work spans full-stack engineering, machine learning, data analytics, cloud architecture, and automated deployment pipelines.\n\nI design and ship production-ready applications using Python (FastAPI, Streamlit, Pandas, Polars), TypeScript/React/Next.js, Flutter, SQL/NoSQL, and Google Cloud. I specialize in intelligent workflows powered by APIs, autonomous agents, vector search, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). My tooling includes Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, LangChain, LlamaIndex, LangGraph, and modern LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, and Ollama.\n\nBeyond engineering, I turn data into insights and insights into features that become products people rely on. I also create clear technical content—tutorials, docs, and demos—that helps teams adopt and extend complex systems with confidence.\n\nMy mission is simple: build tools that understand people, and empower people to build even better tools. Curiosity drives my work, from rapid ML prototyping to productionizing agents and automating end-to-end workflows.\n\nAlways open to collaborating with teams building the next generation of human-centered AI."
