      "0": "Did you know that in many parts of Africa, youth unemployment affects over 45% of young people aged 15–34—millions of talented, skilled individuals struggling to find meaningful opportunities despite their potential?",
      "1": "Hi, I'm Raymond Klanderman, a full-stack AI engineer and developer passionate about building scalable, human-centered systems that solve real problems. I specialize in turning complex data and advanced AI into practical tools—using technologies like Python with FastAPI and Streamlit, React/Next.js, Flutter, vector databases like Pinecone and Weaviate, and frameworks such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, and LangGraph. I work with leading LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Gemini, and more to create intelligent workflows, autonomous agents, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems.",
      "2": "Some of my standout projects include: Kazi Connect, an AI-powered job-matching platform I've built that uses skill-based logic to connect African youth with verified, scam-free opportunities—directly tackling unemployment head-on. AI Health Chat, which won 1st place in an innovation hackathon by leveraging Grok for personalized, privacy-focused health insights. GeminiQuest, a magical multimodal learning app where users sketch physics ideas and get real-time simulations, textbook citations, and live AI tutoring—built with Gemini Vision and React. And AutoResearcher, a multi-agent system using Google's Vertex AI Agent Kit that turns one prompt into a fully cited, 20-page research report with charts in under 10 minutes.",
      "3": "I turn insights into production-ready products that empower people—from rapid prototyping to deploying autonomous agents that deliver real impact. I'm always excited to collaborate with mission-driven teams building the next generation of AI tools that understand and uplift people. If you're working on innovative projects in AI, data, or social good, let's connect—I'd love to explore how we can team up!"

    "description": "I build smart, scalable software and AI systems that solve real-world problems. My work spans full-stack engineering, machine learning, data analytics, cloud architecture, and automated deployment pipelines.\n\nI design and ship production-ready applications using Python (FastAPI, Streamlit, Pandas, Polars), TypeScript/React/Next.js, Flutter, SQL/NoSQL, and Google Cloud. I specialize in intelligent workflows powered by APIs, autonomous agents, vector search, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). My tooling includes Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, LangChain, LlamaIndex, LangGraph, and modern LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, and Ollama.\n\nBeyond engineering, I turn data into insights and insights into features that become products people rely on. I also create clear technical content—tutorials, docs, and demos—that helps teams adopt and extend complex systems with confidence.\n\nMy mission is simple: build tools that understand people, and empower people to build even better tools. Curiosity drives my work, from rapid ML prototyping to productionizing agents and automating end-to-end workflows.\n\nAlways open to collaborating with teams building the next generation of human-centered AI."
